Consider the leftmost and righmost appearances of some value in an array. We'll say that the 'span' is the number of elements between the two inclusive. A single value has a span of 1. Return the largest span found in the given array. 

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer n, represeting the number of elements in the array.

The second line consists of n space-separated integers, represeting the array elements.

Output format :
The output prints the largest span found in the given array.



﻿Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
1 ≤ n ≤ 100

1 ≤ array elements ≤ 1000
